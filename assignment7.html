      Basic HTML Animals
    </h1>
    <p>
      This is the first paragraph in our page. It introduces our animals.

    <h2>
      The Llama
    </h2>
    <p>
      Our Llama is a big fan of list items. When she spies a patch of them on a web page, she will eat them like sweets, licking her lips as she goes.
    </p>
    <h2>
      The Anaconda
    </h2>
    <p>
      The crafty anaconda likes to slither around the page, travelling rapidly by way of anchors to sneak up on his prey.

    <p>
      There are <strong>two</strong> things I care about â€” <strong>music</strong> and <strong>friends</strong>. Someday I <em>might</em> be able
